# Backend CORS Implementation

## Overview of Changes

### 1. Created CORS Middleware

Added a dedicated CORS middleware implementation in:
- `backend/internal/middleware/cors.go`

This middleware provides a configurable way to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API, which is essential for the frontend-backend communication.

### 2. Updated Route Configuration

Modified the routes configuration in:
- `backend/internal/handlers/routes.go`

Added the CORS middleware to the Gin router to ensure it's applied to all routes.

### 3. Created Server Entry Point

Added a main application entry point in:
- `backend/cmd/server/main.go`

This ties together all components including the CORS middleware.

## CORS Configuration Details

The CORS middleware includes the following settings:

- **Allowed Origins**: 
  - http://localhost:3000 (Development frontend)
  - http://localhost:5000 (Production frontend)
  - https://news-app.example.com (Production domain - to be replaced with actual domain)

- **Allowed Methods**: 
  - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS

- **Allowed Headers**:
  - Origin, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, X-CSRF-Token, 
    Authorization, Accept, X-Requested-With

- **Exposed Headers**:
  - Content-Length, Content-Type

- **Credentials**: Allowed (enables cookies)

- **Max Age**: 12 hours (preflight request caching)

## How It Works

1. When the frontend makes a request to the backend API, the browser first sends a preflight OPTIONS request.
2. Our CORS middleware responds with appropriate headers indicating if the actual request is allowed.
3. If allowed, the browser proceeds with the actual request.
4. All this happens transparently to both the frontend and backend application code.

## Next Steps

1. Update the allowed origins in the CORS middleware when deploying to production.
2. Consider extracting CORS configuration to environment variables for easier configuration across environments.
3. Monitor CORS-related issues during frontend-backend integration testing.
